Welcome to Pastav’s Blog! I’m a passionate Linux enthusiast and Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) who thrives on solving complex problems and automating workflows to make life simpler and more efficient

Whether you’re looking to optimize server performance, deploy scalable cloud systems, or streamline everyday tasks.
My goal is to help everyone—from beginners to seasoned pros—work smarter, not harder.


Let’s connect and explore new ways to simplify, automate, and improve your SRE and Linux experience. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pastav99/).
